# Prework Study Guide Webpage

A webpage for notes, tips and tricks that have been provided from the Prework modules. The motivation for this project was to be able to see all this information quick and efficently. I learned a lot about each of the topics listed on the webpage; JavaScript, CSS, Git and HTML and how they all run.
